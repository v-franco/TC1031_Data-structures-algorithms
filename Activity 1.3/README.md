Activity 1.3 consists of a C++ program that sorts the contents of a log.txt file

To do this, the contents of the log were formatted and inserted into a pair of vectors
The .cpp file contains different sorting methods to sort the log data by date
It alos contains methods to print into console the sorted data between two dates, or the whole log (which is quite long!)
